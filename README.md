# Resurrected Cat Paradox: Challenging the Von Neumann-Wigner Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics # 

'The quantum measurement problem focuses on how the collapse of the wave function occurs. According to the widely
known Copenhagen Interpretation, wave function collapse happens when a particle is measured. However, a subinterpretation called the Von Neumann-Wigner Interpretation
suggests that consciousness plays a role in wave function collapse. This idea stems from Wigner’s friend’s thought experiment and raises profound philosophical questions about the
impact of consciousness on physical events. Although the Von
Neumann-Wigner Interpretation is largely dismissed today, some
physicists still consider it valid.
A novel paradox challenging the Von Neumann-Wigner Interpretation is called the Resurrected Cat Paradox, which utilizes
the Delayed Choice Experiment and the concept of Consciousness
causing wave function collapse serves as a counterargument to
the Von Neumann-Wigner Interpretation.
There are additional objections to the Von Neumann-Wigner
Interpretation. Even Eugene Wigner, one of its proponents,
distanced himself from the interpretation over time. Physicists
like Roger Penrose have also pointed out that the evolution of
conscious life relies on the collapse of the wave function, making it impossible for consciousness to be the sole cause of the collapse.
